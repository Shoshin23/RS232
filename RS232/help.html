<ul>
<li>This app uses crossovers to predict buy or sell indications, abuy or sell is a direct reflection of a price prediction.</li>
<li>The 2nd and the 3rd columns under EMA give the price predictions according to the value chosen.</li>
    
<li>A buy signal is raised when the % difference between EMAs are above the threshold value.
    </li>

    <li>For example. When the threshold is set above 0.25%, two consecutive greens(above 0.25%) on the right side imply a buy and hold signal.</li>

    <li>When there are two consecutive reds on the extreme right it implies a sell signal. No further coins are bought until another buy and hold signal(two consecutive greens).</li>

    <li>When there are more than two rows of the same color an upward or a downward(depending on the color green or red) is implied. Hence the app holds instead of making a trade.</li>
    
    <li>You can also change the frequency of the data being displayed. Reduce the EMA values and threshold. But it must be noted that sudden changes in EMA values and thresholds can trigger changes buy/sell indicators. </li>
    <li>Making intervals shorter is usually done to made quick short term trades in a trending, volatile market. A higher threshold could be done for making more conservative trades.</li>
